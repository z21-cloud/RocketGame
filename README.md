I haven’t uploaded anything to GitHub for two weeks because I was busy with my graduation project (I’ll publish it publicly once it’s completed) and simultaneously working through a course (I didn’t finish the 150-day challenge, so there was nothing to upload, as I plan to share the diploma project only after defending it at university). Now I’m uploading a new small project that I’ll see through to completion. It should be ready in about 2-3 days. Going forward, I’ll share progress on creating a City Builder from scratch.
